    <p>The nature is very attractive and full of my favorite green color. It provides us the air to breathe, the water to drink, the soil to make a home, and the land to stay. Nature gives us fruits, vegetables, and grains to eat. We should enjoy nature without disturbing its balance.

       1. In nature, nothing is perfect and everything is perfect. Trees can be contorted, bent in weird ways, and they're still beautiful. –Alice Walker

       2. Forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair. —Khalil Gibran

       3. Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better

        “Nature’s first green is gold, Her hardest hue to hold. Her early leaf’s a flower; But only so an hour. Then leaf subsides to leaf. So Eden sank to grief, So dawn goes down to day. Nothing gold can stay.” —Robert Frost, poet, in chieve comes from Nature, the source of my inspiration.” “Tranquility, serenity, and beauty of nature taught me how to find happiness in life and in the silence of eternity.” “Storms make trees take deeper roots.”
